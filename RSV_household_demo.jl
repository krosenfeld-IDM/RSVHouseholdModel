# Basic_params.jl contains the basic params of RSV, change SchoolsOnlyR_0 variable to 0,0.5,1,1.5 as desired
#Also defines a lookback variable which determines the time window over which RSV hospitalisations were binned (default 1 week)

# SetupStates_HHModel.jl contains code to automatically generate all household configurations and produce a
# lookup table for household configurations
include("SetupStates_HHModel.jl");
# ParamDefn_HHModel.jl contains code to that defines a struct containing all the parameters and other
# data types that are needed to run the household model. The target inference parameters get updated here.

#e.g. probability of age category given household size and sharing the household with an U1
